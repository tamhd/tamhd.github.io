<div class='general'>

<p>I studied Mathematics, but that was a LONG time ago and it feels like another life now. This page is devoted to describe my experience with Computer Science (specifically Computational Linguistics).
</p>

<p>
I see myself as a drifter, who keeps bouncing from one facility to another. 
I have worked at <i>HMI Laboratory</i> @ UET, then <i>Institute of Formal and Applied Mathematics </i> @ Charles University in Prague and now <i>Computational Linguistics Laboratory</i> @ NUS. 
On the one hand, I am quite tired of moving. 
On the other hand, it provides me the opportunity to broaden my horizon (I think), alows me to work with a number of topics, in which the most notable ones are as follows.

  <h4>Question Answering: &nbsp;<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-xs btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demoQA">Show/Hide</button></h4> 
  <div id="demoQA" class="collapse">
	<p>
	Question Answering, part of Natural Language Understanding, the designated topic which tries to fool users that they are communicating with an artificial intelligence when typing a search query in a box, was my first topic. I worked on three consecutive QA projects from 2010 to 2012. 
	</p>

	<p>
	I joined the first project sometimes in my third year of my undegraduate programme.
	Supervised by professor <a href="http://uet.vnu.edu.vn/~sonpb/">Son Bao Pham</a>, our team was tasked to build a QA system for the <i>ecomonics and statistics-related domain</i>.
	Question, for example, is "How much does company X pay in taxes in 2012".
	We approached the problem with a rule-based approach and a set of mathematics formulae in programming language <a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html">R</a>. 
	The flow was like this: <i>question -> pattern matching -> formula \& question entities -> execute the formula -> output</i>. It worked, we completed the project. My colleagues later extended the approach using machine learning with bag-of-words features. 
	</p>

	<p>
	The second topic, <i>Ontology-based QA System for Regulation</i>, was my undergraduate thesis. 
	The premise of the project was to utilize knowledge representation for QA tasks. 
	The greatest challenged I faced in the project had to be the data transformation. 
	The sub-task was to transform rules of the regulation book into Ontology OWL format, which typically involved two entities being linked by a relation.
	We tried several automatic and semi-automatic methods, none of them worked. 
	Finally, we decided to manually transform the rules.
	As for the approach, we approach the problem by converting input into an intermediate representation (a tuple of entities), then extracting related entities from the knowledge representation.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	After gradudating, i joined the HMI Laboratory. My third QA topic was a project in collaboration between the HMI laboratory and JAIST. 
	A key difference between this project and two other projects was the SQL database. 
	Formally, the task was to transform a natural question into an structured query. 
	After much discussion, our solution was to utilize the name entity recognition and bipartite graph theory to solve the problem. 
	The project went up and down, but we managed to finish it in the end.
	The report for our project got accepted to KSE 2015.

  <h4>Sentiment Analysis: &nbsp;<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-xs btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demoSA">Show/Hide</button></h4>

	<p>
	Sentiment Analysis, or Opinion mining, the task you always do when reading feedbacks about the new iPhone before you buy it anyway, was one of my favourites.
	Using the collection of movie reviews as development data, we aimed to classify whether a review is positive or negative.
	The task is document-level sentiment analysis with two classes. 
	We primarily focused on feature selection for machine learning. 
	As for the machine learning method, we tried a few, in which SVM outperformed Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Majority Voting.
	</p>

	<p>
	Fixed the bag of n-gram features, we tried numerous feature selection techniques, including Information Gain, Chi-Square Statistics, Gini Index, etc. We also tried PCA (principle component analysis), the forward and backward feature selection. We also figured out that our datatset of 2000 instances was unstable. After a while, both my supervisor and I ran out of idea, so we stopped.

  <h4>Information Retrieval: &nbsp;<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-xs btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demoIR">Show/Hide</button></h4> 
  <div id="demoIR" class="collapse">
	<p>
	An IR-guy once told me: Information Retrieval is not Natual Language Processing. 
	Arguably, he was right, yet I joined a course of IR in the Computational Linguistic programme. 
	We did our assignment of the IR course by building an IR system based on feature space vectors, TF-IDF representation and cosine similarity. The result was greatly improved by the pivot method, which included the length factor in the similarity formula.
	</p>
	<p>
	I also come across IR when I worked with domain adaptation for statistical machine translation. In that particular project, I used Lucene to index the collection (corpus) and setting weight to each keyword of the query.

  <h4>Statistical Machine Translation: &nbsp;<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-xs btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#demoSMT">Show/Hide</button></h4> 
  <div id="demoSMT" class="collapse">
	<p>
	Machine Translation, my lifelong love, the task when non-MT people constantly tell you "Why do you bother doing it, it is useless, you would never beat Google Translate". Hmm, they do have a point when everyone often compares their results with Google's, don't we all?. 
	</p>

	<p>
	I started with a small group project led by Dr. Ondrej Bojar, domain adaptation by selecting in-domain data. I later moved on to another project called Pivoting SMT, which was my master thesis. 
	We decided to build an SMT system for Czech and Vietnamese (both directions). It was a difficult language pair, partly due to the different linguistic features and partly due to the lack of training data. Not surprisingly, no one had worked on such pair before.
	</p>

	<p>
	I spent time playing with Moses. Simultaneously, we collected data for Czech and Vietnamese. The first experiments received awful results, caused by the high level of noise in the dataset. We performed data cleaning. Then we implemented and tried out various methods for pivoting MT. Finally, my thesis was like a cookbook which described all potential methods to pivoting MT with an example of Czech-Vietnamese translation.
