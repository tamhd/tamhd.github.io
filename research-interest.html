<p>I studied Mathematics, but that was a LONG time ago and it feels like another life now. </p>
<p>I have been at UFAL @ Charles University in Prague, Human-Machine Interaction Laboratory @ UET and currently Computational Linguistics Laboratory @ NUS. 
They brought me the opportunities to work with distinguished people in such interesting topics</p>

<H4 Align=Left><A NAME="qa">Question Answering</A></H4>
<p> QA is my first research topics/projects, dated back to 2010. 
In 2010, we started a project which aims to answer Vietnamese question in the realm of business. 
Back then, we did not have many approaches to select. Our approach was rule-based. 
It involves hand-crafting a set of rules to detect a question, then mapp the question to associated formula.
Writing a pattern set that encompasses every possible questions was impossible, hence we had to stop after some point. 
</p>

<p> My role in the first project was just like a programmer, who are getting familiar with pationing problems, reading papers and implementing other people's approach. However, I got attached to QA, Natual Language Understanding and NLP. I kept working with QA for another two projects. 
</p>

<p> The second project was my bachelor thesis. It involves building a QA system based on Knowledge-based representation (We used Ontology OWL). However, it was problematic to transform the written-text regulation into the format of knowledge representation. Eventually, we had to do it manually. 
</p>

<p> The third project started after I graduated. I joined a project in collaboration between the HMI laboratory and JAIST. Well, there were only two people: a student who was doing his thesis, two of our supervisors and me. A key difference between this project and two other projects is the SQL database. After much discussion, we decided to utilize the name entity recognition and bipartite graph theory to solve the problem. It sounded legit. 
</p>

<p> However, the other guy quited after a few months. I carried out the work for another few months before we concluded that we needed more people. We halted the project after getting the first results. The report for our project got accepted to KSE 2015.
