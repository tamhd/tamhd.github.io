<title>Personal Page of Tam Hoang</title>

<p>This page is created using GitHub personal page</p>

<p> A while ago, I saw a tutorial about blogging with Jekyll and GitHub. I told myself: a version-controlled personal page with git push/pull, great! The tutorial instructed to build a static blog with Markdown. Well, I had already known Markdown! Let's do it.</p>

<p>Excited as I was, I could not follow the instruction until the end. My build of Jekyll 2.0 got crashed (I used Ubuntu 14.04 and I had never installed Ruby on Rails before). At that point, I was to tired and lazy to diagnose the problems. Hence, I decided to write the page content using HTML/CSS. It worked. I would go back to debug my problem later then</p>

<p>The personal page is place where I organize and share my thought. It's for everybody and also for me. I am not interested in the number of like given on Facebook/Twitter. If you want to discuss anything with me, please send me an <CODE><A HREF="mailto:tamhd1990@gmail.com">email</A></CODE>.</p>

<p> Have a nice day! :)</p>
