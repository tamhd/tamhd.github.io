<p><i>Hi! my name is Duc Tam Hoang, but please call me Tam, and I am a computer scientist. 
My major is that of Computational Linguistics, which I have been studying and working for the past 5 years. 
Err, that was the heck of a long time. 
Needless to say, I am interested in working on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics'>Computational Linguistics</a> 
(ep. Natual Language Processing) topics.</i></p>
<!--
<p><i> Working in the field of computational linguistics, but I'd like to become a generalist. 
I studied Mathematics and Computer Science, and I like to discuss other field of science as well. 
</i></p>

<p><i> I spent two years at <a href='https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz'>Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics</a> - 
<a href='http://www.cuni.cz/UKENG-1.html'>Charles University in Prague</a>. It was an amazing experience, regardless of the fact that 
I had a hard time with Czech language. I left Prague in September, but that feels like another life now ...

<!-- (Without any particular order.) -->

<P>
I am currently a Research Assistant at Natural Language Processing Group of National University of Singapore.
</P>

<p>
Since October 2015, I have been doing research in Grammatical Error Correction. For other topics (including Statistical Machine Translation, 
Sentiment Analysis and Question Answering), please take a look at the <a href='research-interest.html'>Research Interest</a> page.
</p>

<p><i> I am looking for PhD vacancies, especially in the aforementioned fields.
