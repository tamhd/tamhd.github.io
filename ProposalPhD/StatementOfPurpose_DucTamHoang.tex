% Talking about the master thesis

Instead of a formal introduction of my research interests, I offer a summary of my master thesis, which earned me excellent score at Charles University in Prague. 
The thesis was carried out in 12 months under supervision of Dr. Ondrej Bojar, providing me an insight into the life of a PhD student.
Working with Dr. Bojar was indeed a motivation for me to develop myself more. I grew more and more interested in computational linguistics in general. 


We approached the problem of statistical machine translation between Czech and Vietnamese, which had been proved to be difficult, and no one had ever worked on it.
After discussing with my advisor, we decided to alleviate the problem by pivoting, i.e using a third language. 
I start the project by searching and reading related papers simultaneously banging my head against the wall of 









%%%%%%%%%%%% A year off #########################
After graduation, I remained wary about commiting myself prematurely to a PhD program or a specific research topic. 
I opted for a gap year to become a research assistant at the National University of Singapore, which is a bit closer to my home.
I applied for a project 


Upon joining Prof. Ng's research group. I was assigned the task of grammatical error correction.
After discussion, we agreed to focus on the statistical machine translation approach, i.e. building a system to translate bad English to good English. 
I devised a method to post-processing the output of standard SMT system, resulting in a significant improvement ($p\mbox{-}value < 0.01$) over a state-of-the-art baseline. 
I subsequently wrote a paper (as first author) on these results and submited it to the IJCAI 2016.  

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Why I am good for you ########################
Time being a research assistant allows me to reread my past research project from a more critical stance. It also gives me sufficient time to search and research for doctorate program that best suit my needs.
University of Edinbergn is always in my mind. Not only it is home of the famous Moses system that I have been using for statistical machine translation, it has an outstanding record of research.

Though I cannot predict how different the environment there is from my past experience, I believe that I can adapt to the new environment. 
My past experience has taught me that I am no genius, but I cane get things done through hard work.
It took me a month to cope with and thrive at Charles University in Prague.
It took me much less time to familiarise with the research environment here in Singapore.
I believe that I can do it again.

%%%%%%%%%%%%% END %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
I love research, leaning a bit towards applied research.
I like to solve specific questions that help humanity. 
I like to cope up with new and challenging tasks.
I like the flexible working hours
 

I started working 

There is a fear among the NLP community that the singularity would kill off the field. 
It is based on the fact that nowadays method can model the linguistics features with ease. 
I am by no mean one of those people :D




Rather than working on one topic for my whole life, I was trying to be a generist. 
It was the reason I keep bounching from one place to another. I start my career 

%Talk about your relevant experience
I have been a lab rat for years. 
Some people ask me whether I love doing research. Honestly, I can't answer. 
Years of being a lab rat help me familiarise with the .
After years of studying and doing research, I believe that I have learned a thing or two about doing research. 

I want to do thing that can help other people, not just some game/app for people to kill time off. 


I see myself as a lab rat, who keeps bouncing from one place to another. And now, I believe that it is the high time the rat need to settle down and do a PhD.



Instead of a formal introduction of my research interests, I offer a summary of my master thesis, which earned me excellent score at Charles University in Prague. 
We approached the problem of Czech-Vietnamese machine translation, which had been proved to be difficult, yet interesting.
After discussing with my advisor, we decided to alleviate the problem by pivoting, i.e using a third language. 
I start the project by searching and reading related papers simultaneously banging my head against the wall of 

Working with Dr. Bojar was indeed a motivation for me to develop myself more. I grew more and more interested in computational linguistics in general. 



I did make a mistake when overlooking the potential of an easy yet useful approach, loosing an opportunity to graduate early. 


I have spent one year doing my master thesis under supervision of Dr. Bojar. 
We aimed to build a machine translation system between Czech and Vietnamese, two distinctive languages of two families. 
Our approach was that of the pivoting methods.
Pivoting method is an alternative method to do machine translation with the help of a third language. 
Because it was my thesis, I carried out most of the works. They include making schedule, reading papers, choosing technology, designing experiments and programming.
My supervisor was so helpful. 
He was the one who approved my suggestion, gave me meaningul advice and helped me when I ran into trouble. 




I leave UFAL to become a research assistant. 
It was an odd choice for me to take a gap year.
I want to strengthen my background before continueing with a PhD program. 


%Talking about your personal life story vs. your professional background




%Why is it good for the university
I always see myself as the one who get things done through hard work. 
When I joined the master program at Charles University, I was by no mean the brightest guy. 
I had a mixed background with no solid, 
However, I work hard enough to 
Finally, I was one of a few students who manage to finish the program on time. 
I had one publication with an excellent GPA. 

I believe that I can get the job done if I am accepted to your program.

The letter is rather formal, if you are interested in seeing who I am, please take a look at my personal page: \url{http://tamhd.github.io}. The page is a free distribution of github that I take advantage.
