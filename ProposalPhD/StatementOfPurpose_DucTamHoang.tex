There is a fear among the NLP community that the singularity would kill off the field. 
It is based on the fact that nowadays method can model the linguistics features with ease. 
I am by no mean one of those people :D


Rather than working on one topic for my whole life, I was trying to be a generist. 
It was the reason I keep bounching from one place to another. I start my career 

%Talk about your relevant experience
I have been a lab rat for years. 
Some people ask me whether I love doing research. Honestly, I can't answer. 
Years of being a lab rat help me familiarise with the 
After years of studying and doing research, I believe that I have learned a thing or two about doing research. 

I want to do thing that can help other people, not just some game/app for people to kill time off. 
 

I have spent one year doing my master thesis under supervision of Dr. Bojar. 
We aimed to build a machine translation system between Czech and Vietnamese, two distinctive languages of two families. 
Our approach was that of the pivoting methods.
Pivoting method is an alternative method to do machine translation with the help of a third language. 
Because it was my thesis, I carried out most of the works. They include making schedule, reading papers, choosing technology, designing experiments and programming.
My supervisor was so helpful. 
He was the one who approved my suggestion, gave me meaningul advice and helped me when I ran into trouble. 




I leave UFAL to become a research assistant. 
It was an odd choice buying time for me to think about my future, whether I should go on a PhD program or become a developer. 


%Talking about your personal life story vs. your professional background

Upon joining Prof. Ng's research group. I was assigned the task of grammatical error correction.
After discussion, we agreed to focus on the statistical machine translation approach, i.e. building a system to translate bad English to good English. 
I devised a method to post-processing the output of standard SMT system, resulting in a significant improvement (with $p-value < 0.01$) over a state-of-the-art baseline. 
I subsequently wrote a paper (as first author) on these results and submited it to the IJCAI 2016.  


%Why is it good for the university
I always see myself as the one who get things done through hard work. 
When I joined the master program at Charles University, I was by no mean the brightest guy. 
I had a mixed background with no solid, 
However, I work hard enough to 
Finally, I was one of a few students who manage to finish the program on time. 
I had one publication with an excellent GPA. 

I believe that I can get the job done if I am accepted to your program.
